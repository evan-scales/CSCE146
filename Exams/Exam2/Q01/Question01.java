/*Solution Description
 * The sort method takes in an array of the type PepperoniPizza called pizzas. Insisde the method 
 * an integer variable called size is set to the length of the pizza. If the size is less than 2 it 
 * returns because that would mean the array only has 1 element which also makes it sorted. Three
 *  integer varaibles called mid, leftSize, and rightSize are created. Merge sort works by breaking up 
 * the array into a left and right side then sorting each side. Mid is set to size / 2, leftSize is equal
 *  to mid, and rightSize is equal to size â€“ mid. Two arrays of the type SortCounter are created called left 
 * and right, where left has the size of leftSize and right has the size of rightSize. These arrays are populated 
 * using a for loop where the left array adds values up the the mid values, then the right array adds values from
 *  the mid value to the size value. sort is recursively called for these 2 arrays. Merge is called passing in left,
 *  right, and pizza from the sort parameter. Merge takes in the parameters left, right, and a all are PepperoniPizza 
 * arrays. leftSize and rightSize are set to the length of their respective arrays. And 3 values are created to keep 
 * index of the 3 arrays. I for left, j for right, and k for the merged array. While i and j are both less than their 
 * respective sizes if the element at index i or j in the respective arrays is null then the code breaks. It then 
 * determines which array has the most pepperonis and adds that to the merged array. Finally 2 while loops are created
 *  to add any remaining elements to the merged array.
